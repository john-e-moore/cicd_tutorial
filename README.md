# CI/CD Hello World Project

I'm doing this project to get familiar with the modern development workflow. After completion, I (you) will be familiar with the following concepts:
* CI/CD using GitHub Actions and shell scripts
* Working with EC2 instances as servers, and S3 storage
* Typical branching strategy and development workflow
* Bash scripting for deployment
* Conditional triggering of deployments
* Rollback strategy for failed deployments

Requirements:
* EC2 servers for staging and production
* S3 bucket with a project folder partitioned into development/staging/production
